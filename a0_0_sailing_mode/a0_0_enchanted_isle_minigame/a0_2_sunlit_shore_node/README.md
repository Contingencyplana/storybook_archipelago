# a0_2_sunlit_shore_node

The grove gives way to a bright, warm shore.

- Capability: Tier-1 minimal slice
- Returns: strings only; handlers include [LEFT]/[RIGHT] markers
- Story text must include "grove" and must not contain any portal tag.

## Tone contract (brief)

- Vibe: warm, relieving, lightly reflective; the grove recedes, openness increases.
- Triggers: subtle memory mark on first entry (e.g., zone="shore"); camouflage stays passive.
