# Playtest – a0_1_starfish_harbor_minigame

Goal: 5-minute manual pass to validate stanza 1 feel and contracts.

Paths to try:

- Hub: a0_0_tide_grove_node → (L) coral_quay_node → (L) beacon_jetty_node
- Hub: a0_0_tide_grove_node → (R) anchor_lane_node → (R) beacon_jetty_node

What to check:

- L/R markers present in left/right handlers
- Story strings include "grove" and do not include "[PORTAL:"
- Mood feels consistent; camouflage is presentation-only
- Portals match worldmap spotlight topology

Notes:

- If both routes feel samey, add a distinct sensory beat per leaf node.
- If pacing feels short, consider a second stanza; otherwise polish copy.
