## 🎭 Camouflage Layers to Explore

- **Fog** – gentle recursion masking
- **Silence** – sound used to imply presence
- **Mirror** – player memory subtly reflected back
- **Rhythm** – poetic L/R choices with no immediate payoff

---

## 🧪 Testing and Build Flow

This minigame will be built using the 7-step minigame node workflow (see `workflow.md`), with one node completed and tested at a time.

Test coverage must include:

- Integration routing
- Camouflage triggers
- Memory state validation
- L/R logic
- Story presentation and branching

---

## 🔁 Escalation Notes

If recursion fails during node construction (e.g., a logic loop, camouflage breakdown, or test gap):

- Log the event in `subtaskmap.md` of the affected node
- Escalate to `mirror_decisions/` if unrecoverable
- Postpone linking in `portalmap.md` until node passes `orchtest.py`, `camoutest.py`, and `storytest.py`

## 🔚 Closing Thought

`a0_0_enchanted_isle_minigame` is the first island.  
It does not explain recursion. It lets the player feel it.  
It is not meant to surprise, but to **invite**.

> _“Every first recursion is a kindness.”_
