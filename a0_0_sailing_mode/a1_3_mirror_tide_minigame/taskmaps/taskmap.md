# Taskmap — Mirror Tide (Minigame 8)

## CONTEXT
- Project: **Storybook Archipelago** → **Sailing Mode**
- Minigame: **Mirror Tide** (8)
- `playtest.py` exists and traversal is validated
- Story files will be drafted later and whitelisted explicitly

## TASK AT HAND
Finalize scaffolds; keep repo ghost-free; prep for story drafting.

### Todo
- [x] `taskmaps/README.md` (this file)
- [x] `taskmaps/taskmap.md` (this file)
- [x] Root `README.md` with file map + testing notes
- [x] `playtest.md` with checklist + quick-trace block
- [ ] (Later) Draft first-pass `story.md` for the four nodes
- [ ] (Later) Whitelist Mirror Tide `**/story.md` in `.gitignore`

### Guardrails
- No `stanzamap*.md` files (enforced by test + pre-commit + .gitignore)
- Keep `story.md` ignored until real prose is added
- Preserve simple L/R contracts and safe quit paths
