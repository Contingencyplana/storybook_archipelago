## Recommended Staging

- Roadstanza 4 (RS4 – minigames 13–16): Type 1–4; Type 4 rare, only after strong telemetry

### Suggested ratios (guideline)

- RS4: ~50% Type 1, ~30% Type 2, ~15% Type 3, ~5% Type 4

## Gates to Introduce Next Type

Introduce a new Type only when all apply:

- Tests/guards are green for the prior stanza (L/R markers, portal guard).
- Portalmaps are activated and playtested without regressions.
- Clear player need for extra complexity (list on Left or Right).
- Matching tests exist:
  - Type 2: list assertions for Left paths
  - Type 3: list assertions for Right paths
  - Type 4: list assertions for both sides

Policy alignment (see `node_type_rollout.md`):

Notes:

- This file will be expanded after RS2 ships and telemetry indicates readiness.
