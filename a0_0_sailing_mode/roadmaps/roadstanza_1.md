## Recommended Staging

- Roadstanza 1 (RS2 – minigames 5–8): Type 1 + limited Type 2 (Left list)

### Suggested ratios (guideline)

- RS2: ~70–80% Type 1, ~20–30% Type 2

## Gates to Introduce Next Type

Introduce a new Type only when all apply:

- Tests/guards are green for the prior stanza (L/R markers, portal guard).
- Portalmaps are activated and playtested without regressions.
- Clear player need for extra complexity (list on Left or Right).
- Matching tests exist:
  - Type 2: list assertions for Left paths

Policy alignment (see `node_type_rollout.md`)

This file is reserved for summary notes or retrospectives if needed.

No further action here; see `roadstanza_2.md` for upcoming RS2 planning.
