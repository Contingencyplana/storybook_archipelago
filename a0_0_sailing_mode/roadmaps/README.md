# 🌊 README.md  
**Roadmap Overview – a0_0_sailing_mode**

> _“The sea is not a level. It is a language.”_

This folder defines the recursive planning structure for `a0_0_sailing_mode`, the first game mode in Storybook Archipelago.

---

## 🎮 Mode Identity

**Name:** `a0_0_sailing_mode`  
**Theme:** Wandering, discovery, and poetic traversal  
**Tone:** Calm, playful, lightly surreal  
**Function:** Entry point into the Archipelago — the player’s first encounter with recursion in motion.

---

## 🧭 Structural Purpose

This game mode introduces:
- The Layer 1 structure of modes and minigames
- Player navigation across `enchanted_isle_minigame/` and future poetic zones
- Camouflage escalation: fog, echo, silence, ripple
- The **primary recursive mechanic**: input > reflection > memory

## 🧩 Planned Stanzas

Each stanza contains four minigames.  
The first stanza is:
- `a0_0_enchanted_isle_minigame/`
- `a0_1_starfish_harbor_minigame/`
- `a0_2_lantern_channel_minigame/`
- `a0_3_fogbound_sound_minigame/`

The second stanza is:
- `a0_0_tideline_market_minigame/` _(new)_

Additional stanzas will be documented in `roadstanza_1.md`, `roadstanza_2.md`, etc.

## 🪶 Narrative Role

This mode sets the tone for the player's recursive journey:
- Nodes feel like waves — each L or R choice is a new ripple.
- The story is gentle at first, but deepens across islands.
- This mode must be **TONS-of-FUN**, or it fails its camouflage test.  
  (See: `camouflage_layers.md → Section 13`)

---

## 🔁 Recursion Safety Notes

- All minigames inside this mode must pass integration, camouflage, and story tests
- Recursive drift or anomaly must be escalated to `mirror_decisions/`
- This mode may link into `testing_mode/` for structural debugging if needed

---

## 🔚 Closing

`a0_0_sailing_mode` is the gentle tide that carries the player in.  
It teaches structure through play, logic through laughter, and recursion through rhythm.
