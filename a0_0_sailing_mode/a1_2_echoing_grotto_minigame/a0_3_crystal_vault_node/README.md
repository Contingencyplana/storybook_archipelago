# Crystal Vault Node â€” Echoing Grotto Minigame

A vault of shimmering echoes, where every crystal refracts memory into infinite versions of itself.

Left paths hum with resonance, amplifying the past. Right paths fracture into glittering futures. The vault keeps secrets but tests those who peer too deep.

**Key Mechanic:** Echo & Shatter
- L deepens resonance (recursion, repeating with subtle change)
- R fractures the path (branching shards, what-if glimpses)
- Numbered actions: 1. Touch a crystal  2. Listen to an echo  3. Break a shard
