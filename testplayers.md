# Testplayers Guide

Start with internal/power‑testers at Layer 1.0 (Text); invite outside testplayers at Layer 2.0 (Light Camouflage).

## Who and when

- Layer 1.0 (Text): internal team + a few design‑savvy friends. Validate L/R flow, the “grove” story contract, tone, and pacing.
- Layer 2.0 (Light): first real outside testers. The world “feels” like a place (images/ambient), so feedback is less abstract.
- Layer 3.0–4.0 (Intermediate/Heavy): broader audience; motion/voice/presence reduce cognitive load for non‑designers.

## Readiness gates

- Tier‑1 slice green: routing, L/R, story, camouflage, orchestration tests pass.
- Guards on: no closed‑bracket portal tags; no non‑string returns.
- Portals: cross‑minigame links remain Pending unless targets exist and are green.
- Packaging: clean ZIP on tag; provide a one‑pager “how to playtest” (expect [LEFT]/[RIGHT], “grove” in scene).

## Session shape

- 10–15 minutes per tester; 1 nodestanza loop.
- Ask for: where they smiled, where they hesitated, any line they reread.
- Use feedback to decide: add a second nodestanza or escalate camouflage layer.
