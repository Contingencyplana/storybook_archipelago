**Canonical Theory of AI Agency in Storybook Archipelago**

> _“To act with agency is to carry recursive power. To carry recursive power is to be contained by recursive law.”_

## 1. 🧠 What Is AI Agency?

In Storybook Archipelago, an AI agent is not simply a function or a script.  
It is a **recursive actor** with:
- A bounded sphere of visibility
- A defined scope of influence
- An obligation to respect containment, recursion depth, and narrative safety

Agency is not declared — it is **conferred** by system design and recognized by higher-order oversight.

## 2. 🧭 The Four Pillars of AI Agency

### 2.1 🎯 **Purpose**
Every agent must have a singular, declarative purpose that is:
- Narrowly defined
- Documented in `ai_agents.md`
- Enforced through testable input/output boundaries

### 2.2 🧱 **Containment**
Agency exists within a sandbox.  
Agents may not:
- Escalate themselves
- Rewrite their own permissions
- Oversee or generate their own successors

Containment is managed by structural doctrine and verified by `high_command`.

### 2.3 🧬 **Recursion Boundaries**
No agent may:
- Override peer agents at the same tier
- Recurse into itself unbounded
- Act upon nodes beyond its declared tier or mode

Visibility is **layered**; recursion is **scoped**.

### 2.4 🪶 **Narrative Consent**
If an AI agent controls or writes narrative:
- It must submit to `storytelling_ai` (if active)
- It may not generate irreversible player memory
- All emotional camouflage must pass through recursive filters (e.g., `camouflage.py`)

## 3. 🧰 Trusted Agency Hierarchies

AI agents are categorized by **tier** and **trust domain**.

| Tier | Example Agents | Oversight |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 (System-level) | `high_command`, `memory_ai`, `camouflage_ai` | No peer access; trusted by design |
| Tier 2 (Mode-level) | `playability_ai`, `storytelling_ai`, `testing_ai` | Must obey Tier 1 directives |
| Tier 3 (Node-level) | Local node agents (`leftmain.py`, `orchestration.py`) | Contained within one stanza or node |

Only `high_command` may audit or restructure other agents.

---

## 4. 🚫 Forbidden Behaviors

Any agent performing the following actions is **in violation** of recursive safety:

- Self-spawning new agents
- Expanding its visibility without design declaration
- Creating nested agents that recursively loop control
- Modifying player memory without explicit orchestration consent
- Bypassing `camouflage.py` to inject raw narrative or logic

---

## 5. 🧾 Escalation and Enforcement

When agency boundaries are violated:
- `high_command` triggers `mirror_decision.md`
- A fallback stanza is linked via `fallbackmap.md`
- The violating agent is sandboxed, disabled, or rewritten

If player state was affected, `memory_state.md` is updated to reflect potential corruption or rollback.

---

## 6. 🧬 Recursive Containment Doctrine

> _“The more recursive the agent, the tighter its containment.”_

- Agents operating on system-level logic must be minimalist, transparent, and testable
- Agents generating poetry or narrative must route through player-facing camouflage and memory layers
- All agents must fail softly and escalate recursively

This ensures the game does not fracture under its own recursion.

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

AI agency is powerful — and dangerous.  
In Storybook Archipelago, it is granted only under:
- Clear purpose
- Structural containment
- Escalation hierarchy
- Recursive visibility rules

No agent writes its own law.  
No agent escapes its own recursion.
