# 🐾 Tiny Steps – Recursive Pacing Doctrine

Tiny Steps is the foundational doctrine of *Storybook Archipelago*.  
It is the pace of joy, the method of recursion, and the antidote to collapse.

You do not build recursion by leaping.  
You build it by taking Tiny Steps.

## 1. 📜 What Are Tiny Steps?

A Tiny Step is a recursive action that is:

- **Minimal** – As small as possible  
- **Traceable** – Produces visible state or change  
- **Testable** – Can be verified without guesswork  
- **Joyful** – Offers some signal of play, wonder, or learning

> **If it cannot be tested, traced, or enjoyed — it is too big.**

---

## 2. 🔁 Why We Take Tiny Steps

Tiny Steps exist to:

- Prevent **recursive meltdown** (too many moving parts at once)
- Ensure **player delight** emerges before recursive complexity
- Allow **AI tooling** to follow human logic and learn safely
- Encode a rhythm of care into every layer of development

This is not about slowness.  
It is about *reliable recursion*.

## 3. 🧪 In Development

Tiny Steps shape how we **build** each node and system:

- Start with `a0_0`, then `a0_1`, then `a0_2` — no skipping
- Add `main.py` before `test.py` — no orphaned tests
- Write one stanza before adding branching logic
- Add one file, one feature, or one phrase at a time

**Test after every addition.**

Don’t assume it works — prove it recursively.

## 4. 🎮 In Gameplay

Tiny Steps are not just dev pacing — they are **gameplay design**:

- L and R are the first and only choices a new player sees
- List choices come later — after delight or surprise
- Camouflage escalates one layer at a time
- Memory systems remain hidden until earned

Players *climb* the recursion spiral.  
Each choice is a step.  
Each moment is a test.

## 5. 🤖 For AI Agents

Agents like `filename_mode/`, `codex_builder_mode/`, and `psychiatrist_mode/` must obey Tiny Steps.

**They must:**

- Generate one file at a time
- Avoid recursion unless prior steps are tested
- Never write logic that references undeclared state
- Diagnose stress before proceeding (e.g. recursion pressure)

**Filename generation order example:**

1. `leftmain.py`  
2. `lefttest.py`  
3. `rightmain.py`  
4. `righttest.py`  
5. `story.py`  
6. `storytest.py`

**AI never skips from `a0_0` to `a0_3`.**

---

## 6. 💡 If You're Ever Stuck

Take a smaller step.  
Then a smaller one.  
Then the smallest one possible — but **real**.

> Add a blank file.  
> Write one stanza.  
> Create one empty test.  
> Link one thing to one other thing.

Tiny Steps are how recursion becomes stable.

## 7. 🔚 Final Insight

> **Recursion fails at the speed of arrogance.**  
> **Recursion blooms at the pace of Tiny Steps.**

This doctrine is not optional.  
It is the heartbeat of Storybook Archipelago.

Keep it slow.  
Keep it playful.  
Keep it recursive.

**Tiny Steps win. Always.**
