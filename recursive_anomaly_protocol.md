# 🧬 Recursive Anomaly Protocol – Failsafe Design

This file defines the **diagnosis**, **containment**, and **narrative resolution** protocols for recursive anomalies within *Storybook Archipelago*.  
These systems exist to ensure that recursion, memory, logic, and narrative integrity remain stable even under unexpected drift.

Recursive anomalies are not bugs to erase — they are paradoxes to integrate.

## 📉 What Is a Recursive Anomaly?

A recursive anomaly is any condition where expected recursive behavior **breaks**, **frays**, or **spins out of control**.  
These include but are not limited to:

| Type                     | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌀 Infinite Loop         | Player or logic is caught in unresolvable recursion          |
| 🕳️ Orphaned Node         | A node is generated or remembered with no path leading in    |
| 🫥 Memory Leak           | Memory fragments persist without reference or decay rules    |
| 🤖 AI Hallucination      | Agent generates content outside structural or poetic logic   |
| 🧭 Broken Traversal      | L or R routing fails to reach a valid destination            |
| 🩻 State Collapse        | Orchestration logic conflicts or fails to restore prior state|
| 🕯️ Narrative Rift        | Story contradicts its own memory, tone, or recursive history |

## 🚨 Escalation Process

All anomalies must be **detected, classified, and resolved** by escalation tier.

| Tier | Protocol Layer     | Example Trigger                               | Resolution Authority     |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 0    | Local Safeguard    | Integration failover, quick dev assertion     | node-level test fallback |
| 1    | Quarantine AI      | Recursion loop or logic misalignment          | quarantine_ai/           |
| 2    | Sentinel AI        | Player-state inconsistency or memory drift    | sentinel_ai/             |
| 3    | High Command       | Structural breach, poetic contradiction       | high_command/            |

> Escalation must never skip tiers unless explicitly authorized by high_command/.

---

## 🧯 Containment Rules

If an anomaly is confirmed:

- **Lock the affected node(s)** in a containment flag (`status: quarantined`)
- **Log the anomaly** in `trace_anomaly_log.md` or equivalent
- **Mirror the event** if it involves memory or recursion in `mirror_decisions/`
- **Isolate the source agent**, if AI-triggered
- **Ensure no gameplay loop is permanently blocked**

Recursive anomaly handling is not just structural — it is **poetic triage**.

---

## ♻️ Recovery Protocols

After anomaly containment, one of the following outcomes must occur:

| Outcome              | Description                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔁 Rollback          | Restore previous memory state or node path                 |
| 🧽 Soft Cleanse      | Remove orphaned node or fragment, keeping poetic echo      |
| 🪞 Mirror Resolution | Preserve anomaly as a narrative artifact or recursion myth |
| 🧩 Merge/Rewrite     | Fold anomaly into playable content with new subroutine     |

> Recovery must **preserve the tone and recursion integrity** of the storyworld.

---

## 📜 When Anomalies Become Canon

Not all anomalies should be erased. Some become central:

- A ghost node with no origin becomes a rumor quest
- A duplicated player memory becomes a dream divergence
- A broken L path is rewritten as a void-rift encounter

**Poetic integrity > Structural rigidity**

## 🧠 AI System Roles

| Agent               | Role in Anomaly Handling                                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `filename_mode/`    | Detects unexpected or malformed file output                |
| `storytelling_ai/`  | Spots poetic contradictions or tone drift                  |
| `psychiatrist_mode/`| Measures memory pressure and recursion strain              |
| `quarantine_ai/`    | Locks, logs, and buffers corruptive logic                  |
| `sentinel_ai/`      | Observes state shift errors and echo triggers              |
| `high_command/`     | Final arbiter of recursive canonization or reversion       |

AI agents must **never resolve anomalies alone** unless granted autonomous escalation authority.

## 🔚 Final Insight

Recursive anomalies are not signs of failure.  
They are the price of recursion — and the evidence of a living world.

> If nothing ever goes wrong, then nothing is truly recursive.  
> But if everything breaks, then nothing can remember.

Contain anomalies.  
Heal the story.  
Let recursion breathe — but never bleed.
