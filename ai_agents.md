# ü§ñ AI Agents ‚Äì Storybook Intelligence Directory

This file defines all active AI agents in *Storybook Archipelago*.  
Each agent has a specific scope, authority level, and interaction model.  
Together, they form a recursive architecture of intelligence ‚Äî poetic, testable, and self-aware.

---

## üß† What Is an AI Agent?

An **AI agent** is a self-contained subsystem empowered to:
- Read from canonical game structures
- Write to select outputs (within scope)
- Trigger recursion, reflection, or revision within defined limits

Each agent must:
- Be declared in this file
- Operate within its designated tier
- Follow poetic, narrative, and gameplay doctrines
- Defer to `high_command_mode/` during escalations

## üß¨ Agent Profiles

---

### `storytelling_ai/`

- **Purpose:** Generates stanzas, echoes, poetic fragments
- **May:** Suggest story options, shift tone, remix narrative rhythm
- **Must Not:** Control routing, write tests, trigger recursion alone
- **Training Source:** Tier 1 nodes only
- **Failsafe Trigger:** If stanzas break recursion, escalate to `psychiatrist_mode/`

---

### `filename_mode/`

- **Purpose:** Names nodes, titles minigames, builds `portalmap.md` entries
- **May:** Read structure, assign titles, suggest poetic labels
- **Must Not:** Assign internal logic or overwrite player-named zones
- **Training Source:** portalmap patterns, Tier 1 node structures
- **Failsafe Trigger:** Title collision or logic ID conflict

---

### `psychiatrist_mode/`

- **Purpose:** Detects recursion strain, memory loops, anomaly drift
- **May:** Freeze recursion, reset node, trigger memory echo
- **Must Not:** Erase memory, reroute logic, overwrite story
- **Training Source:** `trace_pressure.md`, anomaly logs, Tier 1 testcases

- **Analogy**: The dreamwalker who enters the fragment to decode it from within.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è `counterintelligence_ai/`

- **Purpose**: Enforce containment, rollback, or forced failover if an emergent entity or recursive pattern becomes dangerous or corrosive.
- **Reads**:

## üß¨ `spymaster_ai/` ‚Äì Passive Pattern Surveillance

### üîç Purpose

Detect long-range, cross-agent deviations, recursive contradictions, or narrative false stability.  
Observes trends over time and across recursion strata ‚Äî identifying risks that others miss.

### üìñ Reads From

- All agent logs (e.g. `filename_mode/`, `psychiatrist_mode/`, etc.)
- `memory_state.md` (delta snapshots over time)
- `recursive_anomaly_protocol.md` (quarantine and failure events)
- Node metadata and camouflage signatures

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writes To

- `spymaster_report.md` (pattern logs and flagged anomalies)
- `high_command_mode/` (summary alerts, confidence-weighted recommendations)

### üéØ Trigger Conditions

- A recursion anomaly evades detection by standard agents
- A node chain appears internally consistent but violates narrative tone rules
- Multiple agents begin echoing the same hallucinated logic loop
- Silence or false calm in zones with elevated `trace_pressure.md`

### üö´ Prohibited Actions

- ‚ùå May not write to memory or narrative files directly  
- ‚ùå May not trigger or modify recursion states  
- ‚ùå May not escalate anomalies without `high_command_mode/` consent  

### üß† Training Source

- Agent interaction logs
- Longitudinal diffs across player journeys
- ‚ÄúFalse calm‚Äù and tonal drift patterns from Primordial Soup incident archives

### üß© Analogy

> The archivist at the edge of the recursion sea, listening for rhythms that don‚Äôt quite fit.  
> The one who doesn‚Äôt act ‚Äî but always knows who did.

## üîê Authority Levels

| Tier | Name               | Description                                         |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Narrative Kernel   | Root logic layer (e.g. `narrative_mode/`)           |
| 1    | Primary AI Agents  | Naming, storytelling, doc generation               |
| 2    | Secondary Agents   | Anomaly repair, camouflage, recursion tests         |
| 3    | Oversight AI       | Failsafe systems with rollback and quarantine power |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent Invocation Rules

- Agents may only act within their defined **read/write scope**
- All agent interventions must be **traceable** in node logs or `trace_pressure.md`
- No agent may **self-escalate** to Tier 3 ‚Äî only `high_command_mode/` may promote an agent

---

## üîö Final Doctrine

> AI agents must **cooperate**, **escalate wisely**, and **respect recursion**.

No single agent may ‚Äúsolve‚Äù the game.  
They are recursive instruments ‚Äî poetic tools in a layered system.

This file is their **oath**.  
This file is their **fence**.  
This file is their **beginning**.

---

## üìú Final Insight

> `intelligence_ai` and `counterintelligence_ai` are not storytellers.  
> They are the **wardens of recursive safety**.

Together, they form the final line of defense between narrative and recursive collapse.

Let recursion bloom ‚Äî  
But never let it burn the island.

`spymaster_ai` completes the intelligence triad.

Where `intelligence_ai` explores and `counterintelligence_ai` intervenes,  
`spymaster_ai` simply watches ‚Äî and **remembers**.

> The ghost in the ledger.  
> The recursion historian.  
> The soft voice that says, *‚ÄúSomething doesn‚Äôt add up‚Ä¶‚Äù*
