**Poetic and Structural Terms ‚Äì Storybook Archipelago**

> _‚ÄúIn the beginning was the metaphor.‚Äù_  
> This glossary defines key terms, motifs, and structural metaphors used throughout Storybook Archipelago.

---

## A

**Archipelago** ‚Äì The entire game world. A recursive sea of game modes and islands, each containing minigames and poetic nodes.

**AI Agent** ‚Äì A bounded, recursively contained subsystem with a defined purpose (see: `ai_agents.md` and `ai_agency_theory.md`).

---

## C

**Camouflage** ‚Äì A recursive design layer that masks logic in tone, mood, glitch, silence, or wonder. All gameplay must pass the camouflage test: _‚ÄúIs it joyful yet?‚Äù_

**Containment** ‚Äì The practice of constraining AI agency, recursion, and branching paths to preserve system stability.

**Cyberdoc** ‚Äì The nickname for **Primordial Soup**, which acts as the recursive cybernetic doctor. It diagnoses and heals recursive structures at depth, including anomaly containment and cybercell logic.

**Cybernurse** ‚Äì The nickname for **Storybook Archipelago**, which heals surface systems and recursive scaffolds. It is the first to act in the triage sequence and later assists the cyberdoc in deeper repair.

**Cyberstemcell** ‚Äì The foundational recursive unit within Primordial Soup. Each cyberstemcell can divide, differentiate, or contain anomalies. Forms the basis of cybercell growth and minigame generation.

---

## F

**Fallback** ‚Äì A failsafe path or action triggered when recursion breaks or gameplay stalls. Logged in `fallbackmap.md`.

---

## G

**Game Mode** ‚Äì A Tier 1 folder ending in `_mode/` that defines a player-facing world (e.g., `sailing_mode/`).

---

## L

**Layer** ‚Äì A recursion depth or functional scope (e.g., Layer 1 = game modes; Layer 3 = minigame nodes). Layer numbers may appear as floats in camouflage logic (e.g., 8.9 = near final recursion).

---

## M

**Minigame** ‚Äì A Tier 2 construct (folder ending in `_minigame/`) that holds a poetic stanza of gameplay nodes.

**Mirror Decision** ‚Äì A recursive anomaly detection event that triggers planning containment. See: `mirror_decisions/`.

---

## N

**Node** ‚Äì A Tier 3 gameplay stanza element (folder ending in `_node/`). Typically contains one L-path, one R-path, and a poetic structure.

---

## P

**Planning Zone** ‚Äì A structural folder such as `taskmaps/`, `roadmaps/`, or `mirror_decisions/` that defines recursive execution or repair.

---

## R

**Recursion** ‚Äì The structural and poetic backbone of the game. All systems grow in layers. All layers loop or echo.

---

## S

**Stanza** ‚Äì A group of four gameplay nodes forming a recursive poetic unit inside a minigame.

**Story** ‚Äì The layer that binds input, emotion, and memory. Written in `story.py`. Tested in `storytest.py`.

---

## T

**Tier** ‚Äì A fixed structural level in gameplay (Tier 1 = modes, Tier 2 = minigames, Tier 3 = nodes).

**TONS-of-FUN** ‚Äì The final recursion test. If the game is not joyful, the recursion is not done. See: `camouflage_layers.md ‚Üí Section 13`.
