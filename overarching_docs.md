# Overarching Docs — Index & Compass

**Status:** Draft v0.1 • **Owner:** Mark R. Gillam • **Last updated:** 2025-08-20  

This file serves as a meta-compass for the **overarching documentation** at the project root.  
It explains their purpose, keeps an inventory, and clarifies conventions.  

---

## Purpose

Overarching docs anchor the philosophy, planning, and structural DNA of Storybook Archipelago.  
They are not gameplay files or technical subsystems, but guiding texts that shape the whole.  
This index ensures they are understood, maintained, and evolved coherently.  

---

## Inventory of Overarching Docs

- `README.md` — high-level overview of the project.  
- `milestones.md` — top-level milestone log, tracking only the most significant progression points.  
- `conventions.md` — rules for naming, commits, file roles, and structural consistency.  
- `philosophy.md` — core beliefs and guiding principles, including the managerial philosophy note.  
- `planning_spaces.md` — outlines the thinking environments and reflective workspaces for design.  
- *(future additions, if any, will be logged here)*  

---

## Conventions

- Overarching docs live **at the project root** (not in `/docs/`).  
- Commits use the `overarching(...)` scope for changes, e.g.:  
  - `overarching(philosophy): add managerial philosophy note (vision holder style)`

## Notes

This file does not replace the overarching docs — it orients them.  
Treat it as a compass and index, not a full narrative.
