# ✅ Milestone Log – Storybook Archipelago

This file tracks major design, development, and recursive breakthroughs across the entire *Storybook Archipelago* project.  
Each entry marks a confirmed structural shift, system emergence, or traversal milestone.  
Use it to monitor cross-mode growth, recursive integrity, and player readiness.

## 🌀 PHASE 0 – Genesis & Framework Lock-In

### ✅ Project Initialization
- 🛠️ Created `storybook_archipelago/` folder and activated `.venv`
- 🛠️ Initialized Git repository and published to GitHub
- 🛠️ Added `.gitignore` (Python, VSC, logs, recursion artifacts)

### ✅ Core Structure Canonized
- 📐 Locked in 16 game modes using stanza layout: `a0_0` to `a3_3`
- 📐 Enforced naming convention:
  - `_mode` → game modes (Layer 1)
  - `_minigame` → minigames (Layer 2)
  - `_node` → minigame nodes (Layer 3)

## 🔜 Next Milestones

- [ ] Add: `README.md`, `camouflage_layers.md`, and this file
- [ ] Document `a0_0_sailing_mode/` and `a0_1_isle_mode/`
- [ ] Begin building: `whispering_grove_node/` (first playable minigame node)
- [ ] Define camouflage layer logic and entry/exit traversal protocols

---

## 📝 Notes

- This file tracks **global** milestones across all modes.
- Individual game modes and minigames will also have their own `milestones.md`.
