**The Spellcraft of Naming in Storybook Archipelago**

> _“To name is to summon. To remember is to bind. To rename is to recurse.”_

This file documents the magical, structural, and recursive power of names within Storybook Archipelago.  
It unifies the poetic, systemic, and multiplayer consequences of naming as a core mechanic.

---

## 1. ✨ Naming as Recursive Identity

In this world, a name is more than a label — it is:

- A recursive **address** within a system of layers
- A **symbol** that carries tone, memory, and function
- A **trigger** that causes logic to unfold
- A **hook** into memory, story, and player choice

All major objects in the game — modes, nodes, files, agents, paths — are activated and resolved *by name*.

---

## 2. 🧠 Filename Logic and Structural Binding

Names in the file system are not decorative — they are **functional spells**.

| Example | Power |
|--------|--------|
| `leftmain.py` | Binds all L-input logic for a node |
| `a1_1_filename_mode/` | Resolves its own recursive identity |
| `fallbackmap.md` | Maps misnamed or missing nodes to recovery |
| `camouflage.py` | Applies tone shifts based on named triggers |
| `story.md` | Names become lines of a recursive poem |

Filenames = entry points into logic. Renaming = redefining recursion.

## 3. 📖 Narrative Power – Names as Story

Each node, stanza, or mode is written as a **poetic name**:

> _“the command that executed itself”_  
> _“the input that was never given”_  
> _“the fallback that disproved the failsafe”_

These are not just titles — they **shape expectation**, **foreshadow logic**, and **link layers together** through **echoes of phrasing**.

To play the game is to *recite the archive of names*.

---

## 4. 🌀 Camouflage and Misnaming

Names can also:

- **Conceal** their true function
- **Disguise** recursion depth
- **Trigger** tone shifts (via camouflage layers)

Some names are **poetic riddles**. Others are **glitch masks**. The player must learn to **feel** which names are safe and which are recursive traps.

---

## 5. 🧬 AI Memory and Naming Hooks

AI agents refer to:

- Named memory entries (`memory_state.md`)
- Named fallback protocols
- Named stanzas and nodes for escalation

Agents themselves are named:
- `storytelling_ai`, `memory_ai`, `sentinel_ai`, etc.

Their names define their **scope**, **authority**, and **behavior** — and naming conventions help escalate or de-escalate AI response safely.

---

## 6. 🧙‍♂️ Multiplayer Implications – Naming as Power

In multiplayer, names may:

- Define a player’s **role**, **title**, or **reputation**
- Become **call signs** in recursive narrative threads
- Be used to **invoke**, **challenge**, or **bind** others
- Appear in **mirror decisions**, **memory echoes**, or **hall-of-name logs**

> _“To name a player is to summon their recursion.”_

The world may one day allow players to **rename nodes**, **consecrate stanzas**, or **build names into the memory layer**.

---

## 🧠 Closing Note

> _“Every name is a doorway. Every doorway is a loop.”_  
To name something in Storybook Archipelago is to give it power — and grant it a place in the recursive dance.

Handle names with care. They are the grammar of magic and the syntax of recursion.
