> _‚ÄúEvery system is a story in shorthand.‚Äù_

---

## A

**AI** ‚Äì Artificial Intelligence. Denotes autonomous agents with bounded roles and purpose.

**AIA** ‚Äì AI Agents. Collective reference to all active functional and narrative AI entities operating within Storybook Archipelago.

---

## C

**CMD** ‚Äì Camouflage Mode Drift. A state where player tone perception no longer matches logical state, triggering escalation via `camouflage.py`.

**CGL** ‚Äì Camouflage Glitch Layer. A recursive test layer where visual or narrative glitches are reinterpreted as poetic signals.

---

## F

**FMAP** ‚Äì Fallback Map. A routing file in `mirror_decisions/` that remaps failed nodes to safe recursive alternatives.

---

## G

**GDD** ‚Äì Game Design Document. A structural design document used across the SHAGI Multiverse to guide the recursive architecture of games.

---

## H

**HC** ‚Äì High Command. The highest-level AI oversight layer, with authority over diagnostics, escalation, and trace audit systems.

---

## M

**MDL** ‚Äì Mirror Decision Log. A recorded anomaly entry in `mirror_decision.md`.

**MS** ‚Äì Milestones. Logged achievements or completions in `milestones.md`.

---

## N

**NPC** ‚Äì Non-Playable Character. Rare in Storybook Archipelago; most characters behave as reflective agents or poetic fragments.

---

## R

**RM** ‚Äì Roadmap. Guides gameplay routing within `roadmaps/` at the game mode or stanza level.

**RT** ‚Äì Recursive Tier. Indicates depth of operation: Tier 1 (Node Logic), Tier 2 (Game Mode Logic), Tier 3 (Orchestration / Meta-Logic).

---

## S

**SHAGI** ‚Äì Supersafe Hyperadvanced Artificial General Intelligence. The multiverse-level AI framework within which this project is nested.

**SPZ** ‚Äì Special Planning Zone. Reserved directories for metagame orchestration or override logic, e.g., `mirror_decisions/`, `playability_ai/`.

**NSM** ‚Äì Nodestanza Map. A stanza-based planning file (e.g., `nodestanza_0.md`) that defines groups of 4 minigame nodes.
**RSM** ‚Äì Roadstanza Map. A stanza-based planning file (e.g., `roadstanza_0.md`) that defines groups of 4 minigames within a mode.
**MSM** ‚Äì Mirrorstanza Map. A stanza-based planning file (e.g., `mirrorstanza_0.md`) that defines groups of 4 game modes.
**STM** ‚Äì Stanzamap (legacy alias of NSM). Previously used name for `nodestanza_#.md`.

---

## T

**TMP** ‚Äì Template. Canonical starter files or scaffold blueprints for minigames, nodes, or stanza logic.

**TST** ‚Äì Test File. Suffix used to indicate validation or logic tests (e.g., `camoutest.py`, `storytest.py`, `integtest.py`).

---

## V

**VSC** ‚Äì Visual Studio Code. Official development environment for Storybook Archipelago.

## üìò Notes

- This file supports tooling across `memory_state.md`, `ai_agents.md`, and all `orchestration.py` layers.
- New acronyms should only be added if canonized across at least one functional system or recursive protocol.
