# a2_1 automation_mode – Commit Caretaker Minigame

Purpose: turn commit-message cleanup and hangup fixes into a tiny, replayable game.

- L: plan or execute a safe sweep of the last 10 commits (dry-run by default)
- R: improve speed/guards (timeouts, non-interactive flows)

This minigame ships as a Tier‑1 node first; portals are Pending until expanded.
