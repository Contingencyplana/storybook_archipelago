**Canonical Protocol – Recursive Portal Structure for Storybook Archipelago**

> _"A single step across modes is a thousand across structure. Let each be known."_  

This file defines the canonical format, purpose, and safety requirements for **recursive portal paths** used in `portalmap.md`, AI routing, and all story-to-logic traversal systems within the Storybook Archipelago game project.

It governs not only how one node links to another, but also how entire game modes and workspaces communicate across recursive depth, virtual machines, and Azure resource containers.

## 🔁 Canonical Format – Four-Part Paths

All portal destinations must follow this format:

## ✅ Registered Workspaces

### 🧱 1. `storybook/`

```yaml
- id: storybook
  title: Core Game Maker and SHAGI Engine
  path: storybook/
  status: active
  notes: Root design system, editor logic, builder recursion layers.
```


🌊 2. storybook_archipelago/

```yaml
- id: storybook_archipelago
  title: Repair Game – Entry into Poetic Recursion
  path: storybook_archipelago/
  status: active
  notes: Game mode launcher, poetic node recursion, player-facing stanzas.
```


🤖 3. storybook_fun_factory/


```yaml
- id: storybook_fun_factory
  title: Chaos Engine and Test World
  path: storybook_fun_factory/
  status: active
  notes: Randomness simulator, AI stress tests, edge case generators.
```

🧬 4. storybook_primordial_soup/

```yaml
- id: storybook_primordial_soup
  title: Recursive Multiplayer Cellworld
  path: storybook_primordial_soup/
  status: active
  notes: Cybercell growth, AI memory loops, multiplayer recursion.
```

## 📘 Benefits of Heading Upgrade

| Feature                | Benefit                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 🧭 **Navigability**     | Shows up in markdown ToC (Table of Contents) |
| 🧩 **AI/Parser Friendly** | Easier for automation to scan, fold, index   |
| 🧑‍💻 **Visual Grouping**   | Collapsible in many markdown editors         |

---

### ✅ Final Verdict:
> You **used code blocks and yaml syntax correctly**. Now, just upgrade each workspace label to a `###` heading for full clarity and structure.

Would you like me to regenerate the full `workspace_registry.md` with those minor heading corrections applied?
